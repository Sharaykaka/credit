UOB Mighty Malaysia,Vinay Kumar Rai,"This is one of the worst apps I've downloaded. For months now, I've been able to successfully log in only 1 out of 2 times, ie the first attempt has always failed and the second attempt has mostly, but not always, succeeded. On top of that, I have to restart my phone to get the app to stop. I'm writing this after unsuccessfully trying twice to log in. You expect these kinds of shoddy apps from small developers,not a major corporation like UOB.","07/03/2020, 14:33:59",,29,Not replied,1

UOB Mighty Malaysia,firebird P,"Edit: Pixel 2xl hanging issue seems to have been resolved, added stars to reflect this. This app used to be good but now keeps hanging or having issues even starting. Not a good idea to use at the point of payment in shops, when it's this buggy at the basic functionality level. Normally i don't leave negative reviews, but since there isn't (or i can't find it) even an in-app option to send feedback about app functioning issues....","08/13/2020, 13:38:25",,41,Not replied,4

UOB Mighty Malaysia,Agustine Wee,"For younger users, this app is considered done of the most difficult to navigate . I can't imagine the inconveniences that older generation customers will face. UOB has aggressively pushed for its Mighty Secure digital token in replacement for the digital token, but the digital system is far from adequate in terms functionality. The app required me to enter OTP from the physical token which was forcefully phased out by UOB Singapore, and I have no recourse to shift my funds now. 0 🌟 if I could","07/14/2020, 02:06:33",,3,Not replied,1

Used to work well on my Samsung Galaxy S4 Android phone (running Android ver 5 with sufficient mamory) for years without any problems. A few weeks ago, I had to reinstall the app but could not find it in Google Play Store on my phone. I see many other UOB apps eg UOB GetBanker Singapore, UOB Mighty Malaysia, UOB Mighty Vietnam etc, but NOT UOB Mighty Singapore, on my phone. So I cannot download it.  On checking further, it appears that this app now runs on Android 6 and above.My phone's Android version cannot be updated further. This is creating much inconvenience for me (and numerous other users) as I cannot do mobile banking transactions. I believe this problem surfaced after a recent UOB Mighty app update. UOB cannot expect users to change our phone just to satisfy UOB. After all, all other UOB apps, even apps from other banks, and all other apps on  Google Play Store work fine on my phone. What is so special about UOB Mighty Singapore? Pls revert to earlier version.

Even after hundreds of 1* ratings and comments by users, UOB absolutely has no clue on how to fix it. or may be they don't really care about the excruciating experience their customers are facing, and how it is damaging their brand. The bank managment needs to check out how apps from DBS and SC are.","07/23/2019, 16:12:05","Dear srinivas bhylahalli,

We are aware that some customers that have enabled Screen Zoom on Samsung phones are facing this issue. Set Screen Zoom back to normal (Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Screen Zoom) and launch Mighty to clear the coach marks. Our development team is working on the fix and will release it as soon as possible.

We are aware that some customers that have enabled Screen Zoom on Samsung phones are facing this issue. Set Screen Zoom back to normal (Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Screen Zoom) and launch Mighty to clear the coach marks. Our development team is working on the fix and will release it as soon as possible.

Thanks

We are aware that some customers that have enabled Screen Zoom on Samsung phones are facing this issue. Set Screen Zoom back to normal (Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Screen Zoom) and launch Mighty to clear the coach marks. Our development team is working on the fix and will release it as soon as possible.

Very poor app. Unintuitive in flow with payment options and viewing accounts. Every click needs to load, so dumb, can't it have expansion buttons and preload? Does every usage of the card needs to have a notification in the dining? Very poorly imagined bank app. Recently even worse, keep getting corrupted.

But very dissapointed with your IT who develop this App. It crushes all the time. It worked well on the older phone but not the new ones. I am currently using Samsung S7 edge. Bec of the flaw in this App, I now tranfer to use DBS/POSB App which is the best banking App so far. And as a result I have transferred most my funds to POSB. If UOB App cont' to give problem, I may close my UOB acc totally in the future. I am giving you another 1 year to improve on this App before making my drastic move.","03/20/2018, 09:30:14","Dear Celeste Ng

UOB Mighty Malaysia,kyla Tan,If u cant do a transfer from own acc UOB acc to other UOB account as it will load nothing after pressing transfer or pay button. I found another alternative is that select from uob acc to other bank account but just choose uob acc user to send. it still work and able to transfer successfully. People who never try and went down to atm personally hmmm i dunno what to say (😏) . Btw it is so powerful as it cannot print screen and I have to tell the user after I finish transfering amount to the person.,"03/16/2016, 00:46:43",,0,Not replied,3
UOB Mighty Malaysia,Daniel Poon,"Very sleek and modern interface. The old app was beginning to look outdated and really needed a revamp. The new features here are easy to use and understand. Its not easy to add so many new features without it looking cluttered. So kudos to the team! On another note, while it might be a company security policy to disable rooted phones from using the app, rooted phones are very common and its understandably frustrating not being able to do mBanking because of that.","03/08/2016, 00:22:50",,8,Not replied,5
UOB Mighty Malaysia,XW,It performs normal banking services. Yet because of how many things are packed into this app(most of it I will not need) its taking up too much memory on my phone.  NFC cant even be set up. Takes some time to launch too. Hope the simple banking apps will return.,"03/15/2016, 10:37:35",,6,Not replied,2
UOB Mighty Malaysia,Meh Meh,"Used to be able to do everything. The past interface isn't that sleek, yes, but at least it could meet my needs. Uob mighty isn't that mighty with missing functions.

UOB Mighty Malaysia,Dickson Tan,Dislike the changes to the app and website. It's like someone saw a fancy design and asked to copy that instead of thinking about functionality.

UOB Mighty Malaysia,Nur Kaii,Agree that the old app was better. This one is pretty useless. Tried to transfer funds so many times and all I get is error. What's the use of having this app if it doesn't work? I have to go down to an atm machine to transfer?,"03/10/2016, 20:32:15",,8,Not replied,1
UOB Mighty Malaysia,Paul Andre Norris,Doesn't work. I'm using Android 4.4. Whole app doesn't launch... just a black screen. Was this app tested extensively before for its launch?

Unfortunately Meidiya is not currently UOB's merchant and hence we could not educate them on this. For your info, UOB Mighty is not using virtual cards and most other merchants do accept payments using UOB Mighty. You just need to tell the merchant that you want to pay by payWave.

You must have key in an invalid username and password. You can use the reset username/password if you have forgotten yours. If you are locked out, you will need to visit the nearest ATM/Branch to unlock your account. 

A slight clarification to the video - it  wouldn't drain your battery.
